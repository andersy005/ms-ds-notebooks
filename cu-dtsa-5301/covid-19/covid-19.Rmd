## Introduction

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has affected countries of all sizes around the world. The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) has provided a dataset of confirmed cases and fatalities linked to the virus which are available on their Github page. This analysis looks at the dataset provided by JHU CSSE to provide a better understanding of the severity of the outbreak, and how it has played out over time across different countries and regions.
